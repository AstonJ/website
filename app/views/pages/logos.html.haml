      %p
        The Shoppe logomark is a simple affair featuing a mark and text. 
        We want to make usage of the logo as flexible as possible but we do need
        to protect the project so please read the guidelines below as to how and
        where you can use the logo. If you have any doubt, please just ask.

        %li.dark= image_tag 'logo-full-black.svg'

      %p.download
        = link_to "Download logo pack &mdash; AI, SVG & PNG".html_safe, '/files/logos.zip', :class => 'button'
