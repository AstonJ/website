        If you're <b>new to Shoppe</b>, get started by checking our our #{link_to "getting started tutorials"}
        which will guide you through setting up a new application. This then follows onto how to

        #{link_to 'generated API documentation', 'http://api.tryshoppe.com'} which is generated
        from the Shoppe source code automatically when new versions are deployed.
